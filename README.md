# A Study of Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines

The project includes two Jupyter notebooks: `RandomFourierFeatures.ipynb` and `RandomBinningFeatures.ipynb`

In the `RandomFourierFeatures.ipynb` notebook, you can download a datasets that we tested our Random Features implementation with. The notebook also provides code to run the Random Fourier Features method and analyze the results.

Similarly, in the RandomBinningFeatures.ipynb notebook, you can test our Random Binning Features implementation. The notebook includes the necessary code to run the Random Binning Features method and evaluate its performance.
